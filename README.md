**Work Day Scheduler**

#Description

For this project, the users can view their workday (hours 9-5). I was given the task of making a scheduler for my work day that was color-coded based on past(White), present(Red), and future(Green) timeblocks in the work day. Using jQuery, I was able to save items to local storage and display them in the given calendar block, without losing the items upon a page refresh.
